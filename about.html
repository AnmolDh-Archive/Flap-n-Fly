                <p>
                    Flap 'n' Fly is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, which moves persistently to the right. 
                    The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. 
                    Faby automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the touchscreen. 
                    Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. 
                    Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay. 
                    During the game over screen, the player is awarded a bronze medal if they reached ten or more points, 
                    a silver medal from twenty points, a gold medal from thirty points, and a platinum medal from forty points.

                        Flappy Bird was a mobile game developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen (Vietnamese: Nguyễn Hà Đông), 
                        under his game development company .Gears. The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, 
                        attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. Nguyen created the game over the period of several days, 
                        using a bird protagonist that he had designed for a cancelled game in 2012.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game was released in May 2013 but received a sudden rise in popularity in early 2014 and became a sleeper hit. 
                        Flappy Bird received poor reviews from some critics, 
                        who criticized its high level of difficulty and alleged plagiarism in graphics and game mechanics, 
                        while other reviewers found it addictive. At the end of January 2014, 
                        it was the most downloaded free game in the App Store for iOS. During this period, 
                        its developer said that Flappy Bird was earning $50,000 a day from in-app advertisements as well as sales.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Flappy Bird was removed from both the App Store and Google Play by its creator on February 10, 2014. 
                        He claims that he felt guilt over what he considered to be its addictive nature and overuse. 
                        Its popularity and sudden removal caused phones with the game installed 
                        before its removal to be put up for sale for high prices over the Internet. 
                        Games similar to Flappy Bird became popular on the iTunes App Store in the wake of its removal, 
                        and both Apple and Google have removed games from their app stores for being too similar to the original.

                <p>
                    Dong Nguyen grew up in Vạn Phúc, a village near Hanoi. He discovered video games by playing Super Mario Bros. 
                    as a child and began coding his own at age 16. At 19, while studying programming at a local university, 
                    he won an internship at Punch Entertainment, one of the few video game companies in Vietnam. 
                    While using the iPhone, he found that its most popular games such as Angry Birds were too complicated, 
                    and wanted to make a simpler game for people who are "always on the move".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flappy Bird was created and developed by Nguyen in two to three days. 
                    The bird character, Faby, was originally designed in 2012 for a cancelled platform game. 
                    The gameplay was inspired by the act of bouncing a ping pong ball against a paddle for as long as possible. 
                    Initially the game was significantly easier than it became in the final version, 
                    however Nguyen said he found this version to be boring and subsequently tightened up the difficulty. 
                    He described the business plan of a free download with in-game advertisements as "very common in the Japanese market".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nguyen believes that contemporary Western games are overly complex. 
                    His company, .Gears, describes its games as "heavily influenced by retro pixelated games in its golden age. 
                    Everything is pure, extremely hard and incredibly fun to play".

                <p>
                    Flappy Bird was originally released on May 24, 2013, with support for the iPhone 5. 
                    The game was subsequently updated for iOS 7 in September 2013. Although originally unsuccessful, 
                    the game received a massive influx of players after being reviewed by the Swedish YouTuber PewDiePie. 
                    In January 2014, it topped the Free Apps chart in the US and Chinese App Stores, 
                    and later that month topped the same section of the UK App Store where it was touted as "the new Angry Birds". 
                    It ended January as the most downloaded App on the App Store. 
                    The Android version of Flappy Bird was released to the Google Play store on January 30, 2014. 
                    In early 2014, Nguyen said in an interview with The Verge that the game was earning around $50,000 a day in revenue through its in-game advertising.

                <p>
                    On February 8, 2014, Nguyen announced on Twitter that the game was to be removed from both Apple's App Store and Google Play, 
                    writing: "I am sorry 'Flappy Bird' users, 22 hours from now, I will take 'Flappy Bird' down. I cannot take this anymore." 
                    He went on to say that taking down the game had "nothing to do with legal issues". 
                    The game was removed from both Apple's App Store and Google Play exactly on time, much to the dismay of many fans.

                    <h4>Reception</h4>
                    <p>
                        Flappy Bird received "mixed or average reviews" from critics, holding a Metacritic score of 52/100, based on seven reviews. 
                        The app was criticized by the Huffington Post, which described it as an "insanely irritating, 
                        difficult and frustrating game which combines a super-steep difficulty curve with bad, 
                        boring graphics and jerky movement". IGN gave the game a mediocre score of 5.4 out of 10, 
                        quipping that the game is as addictive as it was shallow. 
                        Despite criticizing its playability and its "no skill" requirement, IGN noted that the gameplay made it 
                        "an addictive short-term distraction" for the casual skill and score-obsessed players. 
                        The game's difficulty has been a source of ire for many users, with one user stating that 
                        it took him half an hour to achieve a score of five points. According to its creator, 
                        the game is slightly easier on Android devices than on iOS.
